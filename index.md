# openpilot community

#### What is this

We started this to be a place to house an open community-driven & funded knowledge base for people using [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot), [Comma Hardware](https://shop.comma.ai), etc.

This is not affiliated or supported by [Comma.ai, Inc.](https://comma.ai) but offers free support for the products sold by them as well as solutions and support for openpilot, the software that drives your car.
